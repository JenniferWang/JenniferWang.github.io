excerpt: 
Ray tracing algorithm is the most basic algorithm in computer graphics. Even though, there are several points that one may ignore.

      Why we can see the objects? This is because light from the object goes through the air and reaches the eye. When we want to simulate the light, we need to consider several things:TODO

    <p>
      As physics law are symmetric w.r.t. time, we can trace the light from eye back to the object.

    <p>
      Principle: light that reaches the camera from a point on an object is given by the sum of light emitted by the object (if it is itself a light source) and the amount of reflected light.

    <p>
      For scattering, we are only interested in the amount of light that scattered back along the exact way that we 'generated' to find the intersection point. Note that the resulting picture is the 'near plane', and the 'eye' is the single point from which we generate light to 'look' at the object.
