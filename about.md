### Welcome!

Hi there, my name is Jiyue Wang. I received a B.S. degree in applied math from Zhiyuan College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and I am pursuing a M.S. in [computational and mathematical engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/) at Stanford.

This is a blog-style personal website where I post interesting things. You must have been noticed that many posts are about algorithms. Yes, they are interesting, aren't they? I also love statistics and machine learning. Cooking is also one of my interests. I am trying to find a way to add a gallery module in this static website built on jekyll.
