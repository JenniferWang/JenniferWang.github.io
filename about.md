### Welcome!

Hi there, my name is Jiyue Wang. I received a B.S. degree in applied math from Zhiyuan College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and I am pursuing a M.S. in computational and mathematical engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/)) at Stanford.

This is a blog-style personal website where I post interesting things. You must have noticed that many posts are about algorithms. Yes, they are interesting, aren't they? I also love statistics and machine learning. 

Cooking is one of my interests. I am trying to find a good way to add a gallery module.
