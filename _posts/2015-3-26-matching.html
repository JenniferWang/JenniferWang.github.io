excerpt: Maximum Matching problem is interesting and maximum bipartite problem is relatively easy to tackle with. Matching a couple of single women and single men is actually a bipartite matching problem!

    <h2 class = "sec"> Maximum Matching </h2>
    <p>
      Use greedy algorthim, we can find a <b>maximal</b> matching, denote it as \(M\). If the <b>maximum</b> matching is \(M^*\), then \(|M| \ge \frac{1}{2} |M^*|\).
      <div class = "claim">
        If \(A\) and \(B\) are two maximal matching, then \(|A| \ge \frac{1}{2} |B|\) and \(|B| \ge \frac{1}{2} |A|\). 
      </div>
      <div class = "proof">
        Consider \(A\backslash B\) and \(B \backslash A\). For \(\forall e \in B \backslash A\), it can be adjacent to at most 2 edges in \(A \backslash B\) (at the two ends) as \(A\) is a matching. For \(\forall u \in A\backslash B\), there are three cases:
        <ul>
          <li> \(u\) has no adjacent edges in \(G\). This means it should appear in both \(A\) and \(B\) \(\Rightarrow\) contradiction. </li>
          <li> \(u\) has at least one adjacent edge in \(B \backslash A\). </li>
          <li> \(u\) has adjacent edges, none of which is in \(B \backslash A\). Then \(u + B\) is still a matching, with cardinality larger than \(B\) \(\Rightarrow\) contradiction. </li>
        </ul>
        Thus for \(\forall u \in A\backslash B\), it should be adjacent to some edge in \(B\backslash A\). Then we have 
        \[
          \begin{gathered}
          |A \backslash B| \le 2 |B \backslash A| \\
          |A| = |A \backslash B| + |A \cap B| \le 2 |B \backslash A| + 2|B \cap A| = 2 |B|
          \end{gathered}
        \]
      </div>

    <h2 class = "sec"> Augmenting Path Algorithm </h2> 
      Augmenting path algorithm can be used to find maximum matching (weighted/unweighted) in a bipartite graph. The same idea extends to a general graph. See <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/augmenting-path">this post</a> for details.
    
    <h2 class = "sec"> Maximum Matching in Bipartite Graph </h2> 
      <p>
        Both Augmenting Path Algorithm and Max Flow Algorithm can be used to find maximum matching in a bipartite graph. We can actually describe this problem in the form of optimization problem. 
        \[
          \begin{split}
            \max\text{ } &{\mathbf{1}^T x} \\
            \text{s.t. } &Ax \le \mathbf{1}\\
            &x \in \{0, 1\}
          \end{split}
        \]
        where \(A\) is the node-edge incidence matrix and \(x\) is the indicate vector of dimension \(m\).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an <i> Integer Programming Problem </i> and NP hard. However, when the constraint \(A\) is <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/totally-unimodular"><b>Totally Unimodular </b></a>, we can solve it just as a <i>Linear Programming Problem</i>.

    <h2 class = "sec"> Cycle Cover and Minimum Weight Perfect Matching</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>perfect matching</b> is a matching which matches all vertices of the graph. That is, every vertex of the graph is incident to exactly one edge of the matching. The mini-weight perfect matching problem can be solved in polynomial time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class = "definition"> <b>minimum weight cycle cover</b> of a graph: Let \(H = (V, E)\) be a directed graph with non-negative arc weights given by \(w: E \rightarrow R ^+\). 
      </div>
      We wish to find a minimum weight collection of vertex-disjoint directed cycles in \(H\) such that every vertex is in exactly one of those cycles. We need this to give an approximation algo to the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP). For ATSP, there always exists a cycle cover, but for a general graph, there might be no cycle cover.
    </p>
    <div class = "algorithm">
      For each node \(v \in V\), split it into \(v^+\) and \(v^-\), where \(v^+\) is the 'in-node' and \(v^-\) is the 'out-node'. Connect the edges accordingly and note that there is no edge between in-nodes and out-nodes. Thus, we actually get a bipartite graph. Now we can add a source node \(s\) and a sink node \(t\). Connect \(s\) to all 'out-nodes' and connect \(t\) to all 'in-nodes'. If we want to determine if there is a cycle cover, we can set all the capacity to 1 and run Max Flow on the graph. If the max flow equals \(n\), then there is a cycle cover. If we want to find the minimum cycle cover, we can either run Minimum Perfect Matching on the graph (without the source and sink nodes) or run Max Flow with modified capacity.
