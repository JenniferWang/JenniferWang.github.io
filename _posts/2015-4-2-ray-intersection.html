excerpt: Ray intersection is a very basic problem in computer graphics. In the ray-tracing algorithm, we need it to determine whether the ray hits some object.

    <h2 class="sec"> Ray-Convex Polyhedron </h2>
    <p>
      A convex polyhedron can be represented as the intersecton of halfspaces. This can be further written in linear programming form. 
      \[
        Ax \le b
      \]
      Thus, testing whether a ray \(\vec{c} + t \vec{v} \) or line segment intersects with the convex object or not can be done efficiently in all dimensions. Thus, it is very useful to have convex bounding containers for more complicated objects.
    </p>

      <h3 class="sec"> General Case </h3>
        <p>
          In \(n\)-dimension, testing whether the ray intersects the convex object is equivalent to test whether there is a feasible \(t\) that satisfies \(A(\vec{c} + t \vec{v}) \le b\). That is to find a \(t\) s.t. for all \(i = 1, 2, ..., n\)
          \[
            [Av]_i t \le [b - Ac]_i
          \]
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_of_a_polyhedron_with_a_line">Solving</a> the unequalities, we have all feasible \(t\) in range
          \[
            \Big[ \max_{i: [Av]_i\le 0} \frac{[b - Ac]_i}{[Av]_i}, \min_{i: [Av]_i \ge 0} \frac{[b - Ac]_i}{[Av]_i}\Big]
          \]
          If the interval is empty, the ray doesn't intersects with the object. This actually has a straight-forward geometrical interpretation.

      <h3 class = "sec"> 2D Convex Polygon </h3>
        <p>
          Suppose we define polygon by \(v_0\), \(v_1\), \(v_2\), \(v_3\), \(v_4\) = \(v_0\). The left-hand-side of edge \((v_i, v_{i + 1})\) is defined to be the inner part of the polygon. Let \(n_i\) be the <i>normal</i> of edge \((v_i, v_{i + 1})\), which points to the outside. Then all the points 'below' the line \((v_i, v_{i + 1})\) is defined by 
            \[
              \begin{split}
                &(x - v_i) \cdot n_i \le 0 \\
                & n_i \cdot x \le v_i \cdot n_i 
              \end{split}
            \] 
          It's easy to get \(n_i\):
            \[
              \begin{split}
                &d_i = \frac{v_{i + 1} - v_i}{||v_{i + 1} - v_i||} = (d_x, d_y)\\
                &n_i = (d_y, -d_x)
              \end{split}
            \]
          Putting all the inequations together, we get the linear programming form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, \(\max_{i: [Av]_i\le 0} \frac{[b - Ac]_i}{[Av]_i}\) is actually the last intersection point where the ray <i>may</i> enter the object. And \(\min_{i: [Av]_i \ge 0} \frac{[b - Ac]_i}{[Av]_i}\) is the first intersection point where the ray <i>may</i> leave the object.
        </p>

      <h3 class = "sec"> 3D Convex Polyhedron </h3>
        <p>
          The geometrical explanation is similar to 2D case. One thing that concerns me is how to represent the object in 3D. Every face of a polyhedron is a feasible polygon that satisifes all the inequalities, and what we need is basically the normal of the face and one of the point on this polygon.

    <h2 class="sec"> Ray-Triangle Intersection </h2>
      <p>
        This is a special case of Ray-Convex Polyhedron intersection problem. But for 3D triangles, we could use a more basic observation to solve the problem. The three vertexes (vectors) of a triangle actually form a basis of 3D space. Now represent an arbitrary direction vector of the ray in this basis. If all the coordinates are positive, then the ray intersects with the triangle. A fast algorithm using this idea is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ller%E2%80%93Trumbore_intersection_algorithm">Moller-Trumbore algorithm </a>
