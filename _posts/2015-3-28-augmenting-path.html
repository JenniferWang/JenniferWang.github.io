      Augmenting Path Algorithm is used to find maximum match (weighted/unweighted) in a bipartite graph. The same idea can be extended to solve a general graph, but this is nontrivial (Edmonds 1965).
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class = "definition" > A path \(P\) is called an <b>augmenting path</b> for \(M\) if
        <ul>
          <li> The two ends of \(P\) are unmatched by \(M\). </li>
          <li> The edges of \(P\) alternate between edges \(\in M\) and edges \(\notin M\) </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </p>

    <h1 class = "sec" > Algorithm </h1>
    <p>
      By <b>Berge's theorem</b>, which states that <i>a matching \(M\) is maximum iff it has no augmenting path </i>, we have the following algorithm
      <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="prettyprint" data-lang="python">
  def findMaximumMatching(G):
    match = {}
    while True:
      path = findAugmentingPath(G, match)
      if not path:
        break
      match = flipPath(match, path)
    return match
      </code></pre></div>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the problem narrows down to how to find an augmenting path in \(G\) given \(M\). We consider bipartite graph first and then general graph.

      <p>
        By intuition, we can use DFS to find an augmenting path. Pick an unmatched node as the root and do DFS. Alternatively pick edge in \(M\) and not in \(M\) until finding an unmatched node. However, it does not gaurantee to find an augmenting path if there is one. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the following undirected graph
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="prettyprint" data-lang="python">
  vertices = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  edgeList = {1: set([2]), 2:set([1, 3, 6]), 3:set([2, 4]), \
              4: set([3, 5]), 5: set([4, 6]), 6: set([2, 5])}
  match = {2:3, 3:2, 4:5, 5:4}
        </code></pre></div>
        If we start from 6 and follow the path <span>6 &rarr; 5 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1 </span> , we find an augmenting path. However, if we follow the path <span> 6 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 5 </span>, we can not find an augmenting path. The problem is that this is an odd cycle and two unmatched vertexes share one node. If there is no odd cycle, there is no problem. The complexity of the following algorithm is \(O(n / 2)\times O(m)\), where \(|V| = n\) and \(|E| = m\). Hopcroft and Karp improve the time complexity to \(O(m \sqrt{n})\)

        More complicated and takes \(O(m n^2)\) time. See <a href = "http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac/Teach/CS105-Winter05/Notes/kavathekar-scribe.pdf"> this </a> for details.

    <h1 class = "sec"> Weighted Maximum Matching </h1>
      <p>
        The basic idea is to find the augmenting path which increases weights the most every time. Details can be found <a href = "http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs6820/2012sp/Handouts/101-110.pdf"> here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another method is Max Flow. But it can only find maximum weight matching in a bipartite graph.
